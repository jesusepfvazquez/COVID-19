__Problem__

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the extent at which COVID-19, better known as Coronavirus, has progressed in Latin America. Not only is monitoring COVID-19 important to help local and federal Latin America governments make better informed decisions, but it is neccesary due great amount of social disparities that will tremendously worsen the impact of the virus in the health of these communities. In this report we will present initial statistics and graphical illustrations of the current development of COVID-19 and future projections in Latin America.
